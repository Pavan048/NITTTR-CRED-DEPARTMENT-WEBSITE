           In order that the human resource is developed for gainful
               employment/self employment, the training must be need
               based, and should provide employable/self-employable
               skills. The purpose of the skill development is to create
               skilled and knowledge based manpower by empowering
               them technically so that they can earn their sustainable
               livelihood. The training programs both technical and non
               technical are well-designed through graded exercises,
               keeping in view the market requirements for various
               trades.
               Short term non-formal, modular
               courses of 3-6 months duration,
               depending on the local needs and
               commensurate with the available local
               resources with proper structures, yet
               having the desired flexibility to pave the
               way for self paced open learning mode
               (OLM), are being offered. Depending
               upon local circumstances in some
               cases Multi-skill training are offered to
               make self employment viable in the
               rural economy.
               In some of the trades, advance skill
               course for 3 to 6 months duration were
               designed and offered as per the interest
               of trainees or as per the demands of
               local companies/ industries/ market.

           A large number of technologies have been developed by various research institutions and laboratories
           in the form of appropriate technologies. But, the benefits of these technologies have failed to reach the
           rural population. The villagers could not adopt these modern technologies and implements to improve
           productivity, and, in turn, their quality of life, since the process of transfer of technologies was not
           undertaken in a planned manner.
           NITTTRs compiled the list of appropriate technologies developed by DST, CSIR, ICAR, IITs, NITs,
           Technical Universities and other prominent Research Institutions of the country and identify location
           specific technologies and organise training programs for the staff of project implementation institutions
           on these technologies.
